## A Beautiful way to share code

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VnZM3kd.png"></p>

CodeShr is a open-source platform to make sharing code easier. Wasted by all the .txt files you downloaded and the poor hastebin codes ? Switch now to CodeShr :
* Open [codeshr.com](https://codeshr.com)
* Paste your file's content
* Hit CTRL + S to save the paste, and then CTRL + V to share the link

Alternatively, you can use the [CLI](https://github.com/ShrCode/cli) to create paste from your terminal.
