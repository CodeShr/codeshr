<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VnZM3kd.png"></p>

ShineBoard is a open-source platform to make sharing code easier. Wasted by all the .txt files you downloaded and the poor hastebin codes ? Switch now to ShineBoard :
* Open [shineboard.io](https://shineboard.io)
* Paste your file's content
* Hit CTRL + S to save the paste, and then CTRL + V to share the link

Alternatively, you can use the [CLI](https://github.com/ShineBoard/cli) to create paste from your terminal.
